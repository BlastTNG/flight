README for netisc
=================

This directory contains all of the code necessary to compile the
server used for the BLAST integrating star cameras (ISC). It was
written in Microsoft Visual Studio .NET (C++) and the project/solution
files are netisc.vcproj and netisc.sln respectively.

The catalogue accessing classes were not written by us - they were a
part of the original star camera code provided to BLAST. It is unclear
what right we have to re-distribute this part of the
code. Unfortunately this code also has a dependence on QT (which is
not free for Windows). QT 3.* is crippleware for Windows if the
demonstration version is installed. However, QT is only crippled once
you try to do any graphical output. The dependence on QT is only for
some minor string classes, so even an expired version of the
demonstration library will work. 

The subset of the full slalib library used for astrometry calculations
was provided freely to BLAST for scientific use. This code may not be
re-distributed without prior authorization from its author Patrick Wallace
ptw@tpsoft.demon.co.uk.

The CSerial class used to command the motors has the GNU General
Public License.

The CSocket class was found on-line and unfortunately I don't know what
restrictions it may have. It was modified somewhat to suit our needs.

NOTE
libtiff-v3.5.5.lib and WinIo.lib are not part of CVS, but they have to be in
the source tree for netisc to compile.

The following files have to be in the Release (or Debug) directory
settings_ISC.cam
settings_OSC.cam
setting.cam
badpixels_ISC.cam
badpixels_OSC.cam
WinIo.dll
