Cow is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.  

But it is a wrapper in the weakest of senses now, as it doesn't actually call
the blastcmd executable, but contains its own net client which talks to 
the blastcmd daemon.  

Cow no longer uses the kstfile class from kst, but the actual getdata 
library.
