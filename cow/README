Narsil is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.  

But it is a wrapper in the weakest of senses now, as it doesn't actually call
the blastcmd executable, but contains its own net client which talks to 
the blastcmd daemon.  

Narsil no longer uses the kstfile class from kst, but the actual getdata 
library.  

You can set the host narsil will attempt to connect to by editing narcil4.pro.
This may be overridden at runtime by setting the NARSIL_HOST environmental variable.

You can also cheat and put the host you want as an argument on the command 
line.  It is the only argument that narsil allows.
