fox-spider requires more open files thsn allowed by default.

=== LINUX ===
Under Ubuntu, fix this by adding:

  *       soft    nofile   30000
  *       hard    nofile   40000

to /etc/security/limits.conf

and then rebooting.  (or maybe just logging out and in again, or maybe just starting a new shell...)

=== MACOS X ===
Under OSX, add to your /etc/sysctl.conf (create it if it doesn't exist):

  kern.maxfiles=40000
  kern.maxfilesperproc=30000

and either reboot, or else change them on the fly:

  sysctl -w kern.maxfiles=40000
  sysctl -w kern.maxfilesperproc=30000

You may also have to add to your .bashrc file (or wherever):

  ulimit -n 30000
