mcp-common:

*** Warning ***
You (yes, YOU!) should be very careful about modifying any files in this
directory. These files are shared between different versions of the mcp flight
code. (eg mcp, pcm, and minicp). Your changes could introduce bugs into other
experiments.

################################################################################
Do not under any circumstances execute "cvs rm" on any of these files without
first consulting the maintainer of the cvs repository. Doing so *will* break
the code of other experiments in a way that is painful to recover from.

since we've moved to svn, you can no longer "cvs rm" anything. still, you should
refrain from "svn rm" as well.


TODO:
If they become sufficiently stable and generic, the amccommand and ezstep
libraries could be added to this collection
