/* mcp process record */
struct mcp_proc;

/* Start a process, with error handling.  Returns an opaque record describing
 * the process.  The process can be monitored with check_proc(), and should be
 * terminated with stop_proc().
 *
 * Inputs:
 *    path: path to the executable
 *    argv: the process's command line.  The first element in this list should
 *          be the name of the program (usually equal to path).  The string
 *          list should be terminated by a NULL pointer.  As a convenience,
 *          executables which need no arguments may pass NULL here, and
 *          a suitable command line will be automatically created.  (see
 *          execve(2)).
 *    timeout: the number of seconds to wait before forcibly terminating the
 *             process, or zero to wait forever.  Note: this timeout is
 *             approximate; this function may wait longer than the time
 *             specified.  Termination will only occur when stop_proc() is
 *             called, but see also check_proc().
 *    announce: if non-zero, report the name of the process being executed
 *              and its return value (when stop_proc is called) at BUOS level
 *              "info".
 *    in_fd: if non-NULL, a descriptor which can be used to write to the
 *           process's standard input.  May be closed by the caller, but will
 *           be closed by stop_proc() otherwise.  If NULL, the process's
 *           standard input will be redirected from /dev/null.
 *    out_fd, err_fd: identically, for reading the process's standard output
 *           and standard error.  Again, setting either of these to NULL will
 *           cause the corresponding standard stream to be redirected to 
 *           /dev/null.
 *    kill_sem: a pointer to an int which can be used to forcibly kill the
 *           process asynchronously.  If non-NULL, the process will act as
 *           if it has timed out (even if no timeout was set) whenever the
 *           value pointed to is non-zero.
 *
 * Return value:
 *    the process record.
