| NARSIL -- "Narsil essenya, macil meletya; Telchar carneron Navarotesse"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Narsil is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.

Whenever the commands.h file changes (it is used both by blastcmd and mcp),
Narsil must be recompiled as it reads the valid commands from this file.
Currently commands.h is linked to ../blastcmd/commands.h .

Narsil also uses the kstfile class written by Barth to look for default values. That is, it can look for the current value of a parameter in the most recent
files in /data/rawdir and use that as the default.
