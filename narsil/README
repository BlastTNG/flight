----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Narsil is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.  

But it is a wrapper in the weakest of senses now, as it doesn't actually call
the blastcmd executable, but contains its own net client which talks to 
the blastcmd daemon.  

Narsil uses the kstfile class written by Barth to look for default values. That
is, it can look for the current value of a parameter in the most recent files
in /data/rawdir and use that as the default.

Narsil no longer uses the kstfile class from kst, but the actual getdata 
library.  

By default narsil will attempt to connect to the blastcmd server running on
the host specified during configure.  This may be overridden at runtime bys
setting the NARSIL_HOST environmental variable.

You can also cheat and put the host you want as an argument on the command 
line.  It is the only argument that narsil allows.
