Narsil is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.

Narsil uses the kstfile class written by Barth to look for default values. That
is, it can look for the current value of a parameter in the most recent files
in /data/rawdir and use that as the default.

As part of the configure script, it attempts to figure out the revision number
of blastcmd's command list to see if it maches the one that narsil is using.
In rare instances this may create problems.  To force configure to skip the test
entirely, use

  $ ./configure --disable-command-list-test

See `./configure --help' for other potentially useful options.
