Narsil is a wrapper for blastcmd, which is used for sending commands to the
gondala via the SIP.

Narsil uses the kstfile class written by Barth to look for default values. That
is, it can look for the current value of a parameter in the most recent files
in /data/rawdir and use that as the default.

By default narsil will attempt to connect to the blastcmd server running on
the host specified during configure.  This may be overridden at runtime bys
setting the NARSIL_HOST environmental variable.
