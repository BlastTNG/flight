# WriteCurFile is also specified. Default: @DATA_ETC_DIR@/defile.cur

# of the input, but instead wait for more data.  Default: exit on EOF

# mode. This has no effect when not in daemon mode.

# Set Quiet to have defile supress normal console output.  Default: don't

# instead of a local fine name.  Default: assume that InputSource is a local
# filename.

# find the dirfile it points to.  Default: ../rawdir
