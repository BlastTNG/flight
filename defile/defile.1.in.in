.SH DESCRIPTION
.B defile
converts a framefile created by
.B mcp
or
.BR decomd (8)
into a readable dirfile.
.B defile
can either use a local
.I source
file as the data source, or else connect to a remote
.I host
running a quenya (blastd) server.  Usually, given either input source,
.B defile
can determine whether it is local or remote.  But in cases when it can't, the
command line options
.B \-l
or
.B \-n
can be used to force
.B defile
to assume the source is either local or remote.
.PP
A local
.I source
is typically the name of the first chunk of the framefile to convert.
However, if given the name of a curfile for
.IR source ,
.B defile
will use that as an indirect pointer to the framefile.
.PP
Unless you override it with the
.B \-o
option, the output dirfile will have the same name as the input framefile, and
be placed in
.IR directory ,
if specified, or else in the default location, 
.IR /data/rawdir .
.PP
.B defile
can convert both finished framefiles and ones which are still being written
to by
.BR mcp .
For notes on running
.B defile
on framefiles which are still being written to, see the
.B PERSISTENT MODE
section.
.PP
In order to properly parse the datastream,
.B defile
requires a channel specification file.  By default,
.B defile
gets this from the
.I .spec
file generated by
.BR mcp .
This can be overridden with the
.B \-S
option.
.PP
As of version 3.1.0,
.B defile
inserts frames which it detects as missing.  See the
.B FRAME RECONSTRUCTION
section for more details.

.SH OPTIONS
In the case of multiple, conflicting options,
.B defile
will use only the last option given on the command line.
.PP
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
.PP
.BI \-C\~ name
or
.BI \-\-curfile\-name= name
.RS
Same as (and implies)
.BR \-c ,
but use
.I name
for the name of the curfile instead of the default.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-F\~ or\~ \-\-framefile
Assume
.I source
is a framefile, even when it looks like a curfile.  This is provided primarily
for cases when defile gets confused by a framefile that happens to have a 
number of ASCII characters at its start.
.TP
.BR \-R\~ or\~ \-\-resume
Resume an interrupted defiling.  Incompatible with
.BR \-z .
.PP
.BI \-S\~ name
or
.BI \-\-spec\-file= name
.RS
Use
.I name
as the channel specification file instead of the default.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-a\~ or\~ \-\-autoreconnect
Attempt to reconnect to a remote host if the server unexpectedly drops the
connection.  A new output file will be created on reconnexion, and any data
obtained during the reconnection will not be recorded.
.TP
.BR \-c\~ or\~ \-\-curfile
Write a curfile pointing to the output dirfile.  The curfile name is
generally
.IR @DATA_ETC_DIR@/defile.cur .
but this can be overridden with the
.I OutputCurFileName
directive.  To use a different name for the curfile, see the
.B \-C
option.
.TP
.BR \-d\~ or\~ \-\-daemonise
Fork to background and daemonise on startup.  Implies both
.B \-p
and
.BR \-q .
Error messages (if any) are logged with
.BR syslogd (8).
On startup, the PID of the daemon will be writen to a file which is typically
.IR /var/run/defile ,
unless overridden with the
.I PidFile
directive.  The PID is also reported on the controlling TTY.
.TP
.B \-\-flakey\-source
Assume that a local framefile which is being read is on a flakey filesystem.
This increases the number of attempts defile will make to stat, open and
read from local files before giving up.  This option is primarily useful for
source files which reside on overloaded or unreliable NFS mounts.
.TP
.BR \-f\~ or\~ \-\-force
Overwrite an existing dirfile.  Normally
.B defile
will complain and exit if it finds that the destination dirfile directory
already exists.  Be careful using this option:  before starting the write
.B defile
will delete the current contents of the destination directory.  This will
override the
.I ResumeMode
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-autoreconnect
Don't attempt to reconnect to a server that unexpectedly drops the connexion.
Instead, defile with close its files and terminate.  This is the default
behaviour, and this option is provided only to allow overriding the
.I AutoReconnect
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-clobber
If the destination already exists, complain and exit.  This is the default
behaviour, and this option is provided only to allow overriding the
.I ResumeMode
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-compress
Don't compress the output dirfile.  This is the default behaviour, and this
option is provided only to allow overriding the
.I CompressedOutput
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-curfile
Don't write a curfile pointing to the output dirfile.  This is the default
behaviour, and this option is provided only to allow overriding the
.I WriteCurFile
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-daemonise
Don't go into daemon mode (see the
.B \-d
option).  This is the default behaviour, and this option is provided only to
allow overriding the
.I Daemonise
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-flakey\-source
Don't assume the source file being read is on a flakey filesystem.  This is the
default behaviour, and this option is provided only to allow overriding the
.I FlakeySource
directive, if present.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-persist
Don't go into persistent mode (see the
.B \-p
option).  This is the default behaviour, and this option is provided only to
allow overriding the
.I Persistent
directive, if present.
.PP
.BI \-o\~ dirfile
or
.BI \-\-output\-dirfile= dirfile
.RS
Call the output dirfile
.I dirfile
instead of naming it after the input framefile.
.I dirfile
can be a path relative to
.I directory
(or the default path if no
.I directory
is given), or it can be an absolute path, in which case
.I directory
is ignored.  When using this option in persistant mode,
.B defile
will complain and exit if the size of the frame changes due to a change in a
cur file.
.RE
.TP
.BR \-p\~ or\~ \-\-persistent
Upon reaching the end of the framefile, don't exit but wait for more data to
be added to the file.  For use when reading a framefile that is concurrently
being written to by
.B mcp
or
.BR decomd (8).
See
.B PERSISTENT MODE
for more information.
.TP
.BR \-q\~ or\~ \-\-quiet
Quiet mode:
.B defile
writes nothing to the TTY except error messages (if any).
.TP
.BR \-r\~ or\~ \-\-remounted\-source
If
.I source
is a curfile, assume that the file it refers to has been mounted in a different
location than the path given in the curfile.  By default,
.B defile
will look for the framefile in the directory
.I ../rawdir
relative to the location of the
.I source
curfile, unless this path has been overriden by the
.I RemountPath
directive.  If you want to specify a different remounted location for the
framefile, see the
.B \-\-remounted\-using
option.  This option does nothing if
.I source
is not a curfile.
.TP
.BI \-\-remounted\-using= path
Same as (and implies)
.BR \-r ,
but use
.I path
as the location for the framefile.
.I path
may be either an absolute path or a path relative to the location of the
.I source
curfile.
.PP
.BI \-s\~ size
or
.BI \-\-suffix\-size= size
.RS
Assume that the suffix of the framefile (the portion of the filename which is
incremented as a hexadecimal number) is no larger than
.I size
characters.  This option only is useful if the character immediately preceding
the suffix is a valid hexadecimal digit and can affects the output dirfile name.
The default value is
.IR 4 ,
but this can be overriden with the
.I SuffixLength
directive.
.RE
.TP
.B \-\-verbose
Show normal status messages and the current progress of the defiling on the TTY.
This is the default behaviour, and this option is provided only to allow
overriding the
.I Quiet
directive, if present.
.TP
.BR \-z\~ or\~ \-\-gzip
Compress output dirfiles with gzip compression.  Output field files will have
the suffix
.I .gz
appended to their filename.  This option is incompatible with
.BR \-R .
.TP
.B \-\-help
Show the usage summary and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Show the version and license information and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-
Indicates that everything following the
.B \-\-
is an argument, even if it begins with a
.BR \- .

.SH "PERSISTENT MODE"
When running in persistent mode (with the
.B \-p
switch),
.B defile
will periodically check for additional data in the framefile.  If the
.I source
was a curfile, it will also refer back to this to see if it has changed as well.
If the curfile has changed, it will start reading the new framefile it points
to.  If the name for the output dirfile was not explicitly set using the
.B \-o
option, 
.B defile
will also start writing a new dirfile with a corresponding name.

.SH DIRECTIVES
In addition to accepting command line arguments,
.B defile
can be controlled through the use of directives placed in the defile
configuration file:
.IR @etcdir@/defile.conf .
There should be at most one directive per line, formatted as:
.IP
.BI <Directive>\~ [Value]
.PP
Everything following a hash mark
.RI ( # )
to the end of line is considered a comment and is ignored.  The following
directives are recognised:
.TP
.I AutoReconnect
A boolean.  Attempt to reconnect to a server that unexpectedly drops the
connexion.  Equivalent to the
.B \-a
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-autoreconnect
command line option.
.TP
.I CompressedOutput
A boolean.  Write compressed dirfiles.  Equivalent to the
.B \-z
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-compress
command line option.
.TP
.I Daemonise
A boolean.  Daemonise on startup.  Equivalent to the
.B \-d
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-daemonise
command line option.
.TP
.I FlakeySource
A boolean.  Assume the local input file is on a flakey filesystem.  Equivalent
to the
.B \-\-flakey\-source
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-flakey\-source
command line option.
.TP
.I InputSource
A filename or host, optionally with a port number, to use if no
.I source
or
.IR host [: port ] 
is specified on the command line.  Unlike sources specified on the command line,
.B defile
will not automatically determine whether the source specified with this
directive is a local file or remote host.  It will be assumed that this is a
local file unless the
.I RemoteInputSource
directive is also set.
.TP
.I OutputCurFileName
A filename.  Name of the curfile to use if the 
.B \-c
command line option is given.  Overrideable with the
.B \-C
command line option.
.TP
.I OutputDirectory
A path.  The directory in which to put the output dirfiles if no
.I directory
is given on the command line.
.TP
.I Persistent
A boolean.  Run in persistent mode.  Equivalent to the
.B \-p
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-persist
command line option.  See the
.B PERSISTENT MODE
section.
.TP
.I PidFile
A filename.  The file into which to write the PID of the daemon process.  This
directive has no effect if
.B defile
is not running as a daemon (with the
.B \-d
command line option).
.TP
.I Quiet
A boolean.  Supress normal output to the TTY.  Equivalent to the
.B \-q
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-verbose
command line option.
.TP
.I RemoteInputSource
A boolean.  Assume that the input source declared with the
.I InputSource
directive is a remote host and not a local
filename.  Equivalent to the
.B \-n
command line option, except that this directive is never consulted when a source
is provided on the command line.  Overrideable with the
.B \-l
command line option.
.TP
.I RemountPath
A relative path.  The relative path to use if the
.B \-r
command line option is given.  Overrideable by the
.B \-\-remounted\-using
command line option.
.TP
.I RemountedSource
A boolean.  Assume the input source, if a curfile, refers to a file that has
been mounted in a different location than the path given in the curfile.
Equivalent to the
.B \-r
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-remount
command line option.
.TP
.I ResumeMode
A boolean.  If the destination dirfile already exists, attempt to resume
writing to it.  Equivalent to the
.B \-R
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-clobber
command line option.
.TP
.I SpecFile

.TP
.I SuffixLength
An integer.  The maximum length (in characters) of the hexidecimal chunk counter
suffixed to the framefile name.  Equivalent to and overrideable by the
.B \-s
command line option.
.TP
.I WriteCurFile
A boolean.  Write a curfile pointing to the output dirfile.  Equivalent to the
.B \-c
command line option.  Overrideable with the
.B \-\-no\-curfile
command line option.
.PP
A simple configuration file might look like:
.PP
.nf
       # Sample Configuration file
       InputSource /mnt/decom/etc/decom.cur
                                       # Source curfile
       Persistent                      # Live data: keep alive
       RemountedSource                 # /mnt/decom is a NFS mount
       WriteCurFile                    # Write an ouput curfile
.fi
.PP
A more complex case would be:
.PP
.nf
       #an archiving defile daemon
       InputSource arwen:44144
       RemoteInputSource
       Daemonise
       WriteCurFile
       OutputCurFile /data/etc/archive.cur
       CompressedOutput
       PidFile /var/run/decom.pid
       OutputDirectory /data/archive
.fi

.SH FRAME RECONSTRUCTION

In order to ensure it writes complete slow frames,
.B defile
must take corrective action when it detects out-of-sync multiplex indicies.  It
does one of three things:
.PP
If it finds a single frame out of order between two frames which are two
indicies apart, it assumes that the frame in the middle has a mangled index and
replaces the out of order index with the missing frame.
.PP
If it finds three zero indicies in a row, it assumes it's getting bad data and
deletes the middle frame.
.PP
In all other cases, it determines the number of frames which would need to be
inserted into the frame stream to make it fully sequenced.  It does this by
taking the most recently received frame with the appropriate multiplex index
and repeating it in the appropriate place.
.PP
In all three of these cases, defile sets appropriate bits in a 16\-bit word
which it writes as part of the dirfile stream as a field called
.IR DEFILE_FLAGS .
It inserts appropriate records in the format file to allow retrieval of these
flags as normal dirfile fields.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I @DATA_ETC_DIR@/defile.cur
The default output curfile.  Overrideable with the
.I OutputCurFileName
directive.
.TP
.I /data/rawdir
The default output directory.  Overrideable with the
.I OutputDirectory
directive.
.TP
.I @localstatedir@/run/defile.pid
The default process-id file.  Overrideable with the
.I PidFile
directive.
.TP
.I @etcdir@/defile.conf
The defile configuration file.

.BR decomd (8),
.BR syslogd (8)

.SH BUGS
Quiet mode is probably a little
.I too
quiet...

Frame sequencing on uninterrupted streaming data is almost 100% now.  One issue
remains which was previously masked by the read-write spike problem:
occasionally, a frame gets replaced with an older frame 39 frames earlier.  This
is happening somewhere before the frame sequencing step and should be addressed
in a future release.
