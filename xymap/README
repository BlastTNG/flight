xymap package (pronounced zy-map)
============================================
Created by Steven J. Benton, 2010

You are free to use this in any way you like, but do so at your own peril. I 
can't guarantee that it won't eat your files, your computer, and/or your pets.
If you don't already know what it's for, you probably don't want to use it.

xymap is based on code from Enzo Pascale. If his did not have several
hard-to-install dependencies, I never would have reimplemented it.


BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
============================================
The only remaining dependencies are GetData (http://getdata.sourceforge.net), a
reasonably current C++ compiler (I curently use g++ 4.4.1), and gnuplot.

1. GetData must be downloaded and installed from source. Follow its directions.
2. Compilers and gnuplot have precompiled binaries you can install.
  On Ubuntu:
    $sudo apt-get install build-essential gnuplot
3. Compile
    $make


PACKAGE CONTENTS
============================================
lockinmap.cc - heart of xymap package. Given detector response to a chopped
  source, a chopper reference, and source position (all in dirfile format), it
  will output a filtered/normalized/locked-in ASCII stream of X, Y, signal.

iirfilter.h - implements a framework for IIR filter function-classes. Can only
  actually use a few Bessel fitler cases that I've solved analytically.
  TODO: this framework would become actually useful if combined with numeric
    filter design code, rather than relying on specific analytic solutions.

doplot - gnuplot mapping script

domaps - helper script to put everything together. With a bit of customization,
  you will probably find this useful.
