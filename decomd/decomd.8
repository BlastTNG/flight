.TH decomd 8 "23 September 2004" "version 1.1" "BLAST UTILITIES"
.SH NAME
decomd \(em BLAST decom daemon
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nh
.B decomd 
.hy

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B decomd
writes the decom stream to disk.  The decom stream is read from
.B /dev/decom_pci 
and the data is writen to a
.BR mcp
style framefile in
.nh
.BR /mnt/decom/rawdir .
.hy
The framefile name consists of the seconds since the Epoch (see
.BR time (2))
plus a suffix
.IR y .
A channel specification file is also writen.  These files are designed to be
read by
.BR defile (1).

The daemon is able to detect polarity inversions from the bit synchroniser,
and rectify the polarity on the fly.  Before writing the data to disk,
.B decomd
also verifies the CRC checksum of each frame and inserts into the framefile
a field indicating whether the CRC check passed or failed.  See the 
.B "ADDED FIELDS"
section for a complete list of fields inserted into the frame stream by the
decom daemon.

In addition to writing the data stream,
.B decomd
listens on port
.I 11411
and gives information on the status of the decom daemon to clients connected
to this port.  See the source code for the format of these messages.

When invoked from the command line,
.B decomd
will immediately fork to background and report the daemon's process-id
on the tty.

.SH ADDED FIELDS
The daemon inserts the following fields into the data stream when writing the
data to disk:
.TP
.I crc_ok
A single bit which is high when the CRC checksum passed for the frame.
.TP
.I polarity
A single bit which is high when the polarity is normal and low when it is 
inverted.
.TP
.I decom_unlock
An integer which counts the number of times the decom PCI card has come
unlocked.

.SH SIGNALS
.BR decomd
responds to the following signals:
.TP
.I SIGHUP
Signals the daemon to cycle: the current framefile is flushed and closed and
a new framefile with a new name is opened.
.TP
.I SIGINT
Signals the daemon to go into a
.I paused
state.  The decom stream is still read, but no data is writen to disk.  The
daemon remains in this state until it gets either a
.I SIGTERM
or a
.IR SIGHUP .
.TP
.I SIGTERM
Signals the daemon to flush the output and terminate.
.PP
The results of sending other signals to the daemon are undefined.  A Perl
utilitity,
.BR decomctl (8)
is provided to simplify controlling the decom daemon.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/run/decomd.pid
The process-id file.
.TP
.I /mnt/decom/etc/decom.cur
The name of the current framefile.
.TP
.I /mnt/decom/rawdir
The directory into which the framefiles are writen.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR decomctl (8),
.BR defile (1)
