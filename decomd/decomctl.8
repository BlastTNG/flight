.IR | " help " )

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B decomctl
is a perl script that interfaces with the
.BR decomd (8)
decom daemon.
It can be used to both command and monitor the daemons status, and is designed
in such a way that it can be used as a
.I SYSV
init script.

.SH ACTIONS
.B decomctl
recognises the following actions:
.TP
.I start
Causes
.B decomctl
to spawn a new
.BR decomd ,
if it doesn't detect one already running.
.TP
.I restart
Equivalent to
.B decomctl
.I stop
.B && decomctl
.I start
.TP
.I stop
If
.B decomd
is running, signals it to terminate by sending it
.IR SIGTERM .
.TP
.I status
If
.B decomd
is running, attempts to connect to the listening port and pretty prints status
information as reported by the daemon to the tty.
.TP
.I pause
If
.B decomd
is running, signals it to pause by sending it
.IR SIGINT .
.TP
.I cycle
If
.B decomd
is running, signals it to cycle by sending it
.IR SIGHUP .
This will bring the daemon out of pause if it was previously sent a
.IR SIGINT .
.TP
.I help
Prints a usage summary and license information and exits.

.SH FILES
.TP
.I /var/run/decomd.pid
The daemon process-id file.

.SH SEE ALSO
.BR decomd (8),
.BR defile (1),
.BR perl (1)

.SH BUGS
.B decomctl
is a little too trusting of 
.IR decomd.pid :
if the file doesn't exist, it assumes that decomd isn't running, otherwise it
assumes that whatever the number is, that's the PID of the daemon and will
gladly send signals to whatever process that might happen to correspond to.
