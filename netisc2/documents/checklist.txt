Star Camera pre-flight checklist

1. Before mounting the star cameras:
   i)   Check that the home focus position is near infinity.

   ii)  To re-calculate the bad pixel files, cover the end of the camera
        and take dark frames with the following integration times and send
        them to Ed:
        1s, 2s, 5s, 10s 

   iii) Make sure the hard disks are in good shape. First delete any old
        files (execute batch file that deletes images/serverlog):

        cd \isc_stable\source_netisc\release
        reset

        The c: drive should have about 68 GB available.

        Then run chkdsk. 

        Solve problems.


2. Check that the clocks / NTP clients are setup correctly:
   i)   The time zone in the windows date/time window should be GMT (un-check
        the "adjust clock for daylight savings" box!).

   ii) The NTP client settings are accessed through NTPTime in the
       control panel. Make sure that the servers are setup correctly for
       the gondola and verify that they give the correct time.

3. Check the settings files for the camera (note that copies of
settings.cam settings_ISC.cam and settings_OSC.cam, badpixels_ISC.cam
and badpixels_OSC.cam are in the CVS for netisc on galadriel):

        cd \isc_stable\source_netisc\release                    

settings.cam: non-camera specific server settings (most get overriden
by MCP but they should still get set to reasonable values for launch). Update
the longitude and latitude fields to reflect the values at McMurdo.

settings_ISC/OSC.cam: camera-specific server settings (both star
camera computers have both files present, and netisc detects which camera
it has on startup to decide which file to read). Put in the best guess for
the camera rotation (0 is probably fine).


4. Install the current badpixels_ISC/OSC.cam onto each camera. Run the
camera in a dark room with long integration times (1s) to verify that
no noisy pixels get repeatedly detected as sources.


5. Presumably we'll do alignment tests to work out the OSC/ISC offsets to the
primary beam like we did in Sweden.

6. Before launch while we still have TCP/IP to the gondola
   i)   Delete old files with the server (netisc) turned off:
          cd \isc_stable\source_netisc\release
          reset.

   ii)  Verify that the virus definitions file is up-to-date and turn off
        windows live updates.

   iii) Re-start the server using the link to master.bat in the startup
        menu.

7. Before launch set default values with Narsil:
        (*) = ISC/OSC

        * Housekeeping:
          *_full_screen
          *_hold_current 0
          *_save_period  120 
          *_trig_ext

          *_run

            fast = 80
            slow = 500
