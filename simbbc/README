BLASTbus Simulator README:

simbbc.c is the device driver simulator for the BLASTbus.
It requires Linux kernels more recent than 2.6.22

To install the driver execute the following commands from the simbbc
directory containing the source code:

make
su -c "make install"

to load, unload and restart the driver, run as root the following
commands:

/etc/init.d/simbbc start
/etc/init.d/simbbc stop
/etc/init.d/simbbc restart


##################################################################
The driver inject on the simulated bus few simulated channels: 
lat, lon, gyro1, gyro2, gyro3, starcameras triggers and pulses.
Have a look at simbbc.h and modify it accordingly. In particular, you
will want to update lat and lon to reflect your geographical 
position. Also, verify the NODE and CHANNEL of the varius fields
in simbbc.h, they have to reflect tc_struct.c in mcp.

The driver access the paralle port, and output on the data pins:
data0: ISC trigger
data1: OSC trigger

these are TTL signals that can be routed to the cameras external 
trigger input.

Make sure that parport, or any other driver accessing the parallel
port, is not loaded into the kernel memory.

TIMING
the timing of each fast frame in the real pci card is 100Hz.
The simulator simulate this timing using the linux jiffies. The
fast frames are sent at the jiffies rate, wich is implementation dependent.
Look at the HZ definition in /usr/include/asm/param.h to learn what is
your implementation.
