BLASTbus Simulator README:

simbbc.c is the device driver simulator for the BLASTbus.
It requires Linux kernels more recent than 2.6.22

To install the driver execute the following commands from the simbbc
directory containing the source code:

make
su -c "make install"

to load, unload and restart the driver, run as root the following
commands:

/etc/init.d/simbbc start
/etc/init.d/simbbc stop
/etc/init.d/simbbc restart


##################################################################
The driver inject on the simulated bus few simulated channels: 
lat, lon, gyro1, gyro2, gyro3, starcameras triggers and pulses.
Have a look at simbbc.h and modify it accordingly. In particular, you
will want to update lat and lon to reflect your geographical 
position.

The driver access the paralle port, and output on the data pins:
data0: ISC trigger
data1: OSC trigger

these are TTL signals that can be routed to the cameras external 
trigger input.

Make sure that parport, or any other driver accessing the parallel
port, is not loaded into the kernel memory.
