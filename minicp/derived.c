/* Don's Handy Guide to adding derived channels:
 *
 * There are seven types of derived channels which can be added to the format
 * file.  Channel names are, of course, case sensitive.  On start-up, both
 * mcp and decomd run sanity checks on the channel lists, including the derived
 * channel list.  The checks will fail for the derived channel list if either
 * a source channel doesn't exist or a derived channel has a name already in
 * use.  Listed below are the derived channel types and their arguments.  If
 * more derived channel types are desired, please ask me to add them.  --dvw
 *
 * o LINCOM: Single field calibration.  Arguments:
 *   1.  Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  Source Channel Name (string)
 *   3.  Calibration Slope (double)
 *   4.  Calibration Intercept (double)
 * o LINCOM2: Two field linear combination
 *   1.  Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  Source 1 Channel Name (string)
 *   3.  Source 1 Calibration Slope (double)
 *   4.  Source 1 Calibration Intercept (double)
 *   5.  Source 2 Channel Name (string)
 *   6.  Source 2 Calibration Slope (double)
 *   7.  Source 2 Calibration Intercept (double)
 * o LINTERP: Linearly interpolated look up table
 *   1.  Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  Source Channel Name (string)
 *   3.  Full Path to Look Up Table File (string)
 * o BITFIELD: Single bit channels derived from a common source channel
 *   1.  Source Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  Bit 0 Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   3.  Bit 1 Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   ...
 *   17. Bit 15 Derived Channel Name (string)
 *
 *      NB: Bits for which no channel is defined should be given an empty string
 *      "" as a channel name.  Additionally, unused trailing high-bit channels
 *      can be omitted.
 * o BITWORD: A multi-bit channel extracted from a larger source channel
 *   1.  Derived Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  Source Channel Name (string)
 *   3.  First bit of the bitword, numbered from zero (integer)
 *   4.  Length of the bitword (integer)
 * o COMMENT: A litteral comment to be inserted into the format file
 *   1.  Comment Text (string) -- there is no need to include the comment
 *       delimiter (#).
 * o UNITS: meta data defining units and quantity for existing fields
 *   1.  Source Channel Name (string)
 *   2.  String for the quantity (eg "Temperature")
 *   3.  String for the Units (eg, "^oC")
 *
 *
 * In addition to the derived channels derived below, defile will add the
 * "Nice CPU Values" (to wit: CPU_SEC, CPU_HOUR, etc.), properly offset to the
 * start of the file, to the end of the format file.
