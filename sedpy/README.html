<h1>Using <em>sedpy</em></h1>

<p><em>sedpy</em> parses a description file that describes a complete electrical/cabling
system. This is done by running the <code>sedparser.py</code> script, which accepts the
filename of a description file as its argument. If unspecified, it will look for
a file named <code>description.txt</code>.</p>

<p>Once parsing is complete, the data is used to produce various outputs. The
primary output is database files containing the description, but it also creates
a count of the CONNECTORs used, and a new version of the description file. To
disable any of these functions, modify the main function of <code>sedparser.py</code>. (Or,
to be really fancy, change it to accept command line switches.)</p>

<h2>Statistics output</h2>

<p>This is created by the parser itself and contains a list of all COMPONENTs and
explicitly declared CABLEs, with the number of JACKs and LINEs that each
contains. The output is in <code>./out/stats.txt</code>.</p>

<h2>Database "infile" output</h2>

<p>The primary purpose of <em>sedpy</em> is to produce a raw dump of database tables to be
imported into a BEDthingy-style database, for viewing on the web. The parser
puts this output in the directory <code>./out</code>. The script <code>replacetables</code>, and the
accompanying <code>replacetables.sql</code> are used to import the data into such a
database. For security reasons, <code>replacetables</code> must be run on the system that
hosts the BEDthingy database. It must be updated to specify a <code>DESCTIPTION FILE</code>
and <code>DATABASE</code>.</p>

<h2>Connector count output</h2>

<p>Useful for stocking parts for making the cables in a system. Note that both ends
of every connection are counted. This is useful when the component is a box that
will be made in-house. However, it also counts connectors on boxes that may come
with the connector attached. These will be overcounted. The output is in
<code>./out/connector_count.txt</code>.</p>

<h2>New description output</h2>

<p>Description files have several optional or placeholder values for the parser to
figure out or replace internally. After parsing the description, a new and
slightly more specific description is saved in <code>./out/newdescription.txt</code>. The
primary difference is that CABLEs and JACKs will be assigned global database
numbers. Otherwise their names are used as an internal reference only. This 
change is so that updates to the description won't change previously assigned
JACK and CABLE numbers. <em>sedpy</em> also uses its own preferred syntax (ie sjb's),
which may change the format of some lines.</p>

<p>All changes that will be made to the new description:</p>

<ul>
<li>JACK and CABLE declarations are assigned global database numbers
<ul>
<li>Directly mated JACKs (without a p2p cable) are assigned a common number</li>
</ul></li>
<li>p2p CABLEs with unspecified names will be assigned an explicit name</li>
<li>Whitespace between tokens is always a single space character</li>
<li>Lines containing only whitespace or comments are left unchanged</li>
<li>JACK and LINE declarations are indented by 4 spaces</li>
<li>For LINE declarations
<ul>
<li>a semi-colon separates JACK and PIN numbers, no spaces are used</li>
<li>multiple JACK-PIN tuples are separated by a comma and no space</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Typical workflow</h2>

<p>Because <code>replacetables</code> does a mass rewrite of the whole database, even for
small changes, some method is needed to track changes. The easiest way to do so
is with a Revision Control System, like <code>cvs</code>. This section outlines the
process by which to use <em>sedpy</em> and <code>cvs</code> to make and track changes to the
database. It uses <em>spider</em> as an example</p>

<ol>
<li>Get an up-to-date version of the description file. If you already have a copy
then run <br />
  <code>$ cd /path/to/sedpy</code> <br />
  <code>$ cvs up</code> <br />
Or if you don't yet have a copy <br />
  <code>$ cvs checkout sedpy</code> <br />
  <code>$ cd sedpy</code></li>
<li>Check that <code>DESCTIPTION FILE</code> and <code>DATABASE</code> are correct in <code>replacetables</code>.
For <em>spider</em> these should read <code>spider.txt</code> and <code>spider</code></li>
<li>Make changes to the description file, using shorthand and omitting optional
tokens where possible/desired</li>
<li>Parse your description file <br />
  <code>$ ./sedparser.py spider.txt</code></li>
<li>Compare the output in <code>./out/newdescription.txt</code> to the original description.
Often uncaught mistakes in the description file will be more evident here, or
you might discover a bug in <code>sedparser.py</code>. To view differences, try the Unix
<code>diff</code> utility, or a graphical equivalent (eg <code>meld</code> on linux, or <code>WinMerge</code>
on Windows) <br />
  <code>$ diff -u spider.txt ./out/newdescription.txt</code></li>
<li>If everything looks okay, replace your old description file with
<code>./out/newdescription.txt</code> <br />
  <code>$ cp ./out/newdescription.txt spider.txt</code></li>
<li>If you feel like being extra careful (and you should!) repeat steps 4 and 5.
There should be no new changes in <code>./out/newdescription.txt</code></li>
<li>Commit your changes to the description with <br />
  <code>$ cvs commit</code></li>
<li>On the database server, get the new changes: <br />
  <code>$ ssh galadriel.astro.utoronto.ca</code> <br />
  <code>$ cd /path/to/sedpy</code> <br />
  <code>$ cvs up</code></li>
<li>Finally, on the database server, update the database <br />
  <code>$ ./replacetables</code></li>
</ol>

<h1>Description File Syntax</h1>

<p><em>sedpy</em> description files contain a series of lines for declaring CONNECTORs,
COMPONENTs, CABLEs, JACKs, and LINEs. White space at the beginning or end of a
line is stripped, and space between tokens can be of any type and length. Lines
starting with a <code>#</code> character are comments, and ignored by the parser.</p>

<p>CONNECTORs appear at the beginning of the file and declare the possible types of
JACKs that can be used in the rest of the file. The CONNECTOR section ends with
a line: <br />
    <code>*ENDCONNECTORLIST</code></p>

<p>COMPONENTs are meant to describe boxes or other objects that contain JACKs.
Usually JACKs on COMPONENTs connect to a CABLE, which then goes to another
COMPONENT. However, it is possible for JACKs on COMPONENTs to mate directly to
other COMPONENTs. Within a COMPONENT, the various signals connected to PINs on
JACKs are described by LINEs. LINEs can connect to one or more PINs on one or
more JACKs. They name the PINs, and indicate when PINs are connected to each
other. COMPONENTs can be declared as being physically or logically part of
another COMPONENT, called its supercomponent.</p>

<p>Like COMPONENTs, CABLEs are objects that contain JACKs and LINEs. Because CABLEs
are physically different from COMPONENTs, they have different parameters. They
have lengths, can't have a supercomponent, and are assigned numbers rather than
names. JACKs and LINEs are declared the same for CABLEs as for COMPONENTs. Most
CABLEs are pin-to-pin (p2p) and simply route LINEs between identical PINs of
mating or identical CONNECTORs. Rather than be declared explicitly, p2p CABLEs
can be created automatically as part of a JACK declaration. Only CABLEs with
more than two JACKs, or with unmatching CONNECTORs must be declared explicitly.</p>

<p>JACKs specify how COMPONENTs and CABLEs connect to each other. Each JACK has a
CONNECTOR type, a gender, and a destination JACK of a mating CONNECTOR type. A
JACK will also contain PINs to describe how and where it passes signals. PINs
are created as part of LINE declarations. JACKs must be declared after a
COMPONENT or CABLE, and are taken to be part of the most recently declared one.</p>

<p>LINEs describe an individual signal within a COMPONENT or CABLE. Roughly, LINEs
can be thought of as a strand of wire. Every electrically distinct signal in a 
COMPONENT or CABLE has a LINE, and the LINE indicates which PINs on which JACKs
it is connected to. Like JACKs, LINEs are taken to be a part of the most 
recently declared COMPONENT or CABLE. They must be declared after any JACK on
which they have PINs.</p>

<p>In the descriptions below, square brackets <code>[...]</code> enclose optional tokens, and
the token descriptions use simple regular expression syntax to describe the type
and number of characters allowed. For example, <code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,8}</code> allows tokens of
1 to 8 characters containing uppercase letters (<code>A-Z</code>), numerals (<code>0-9</code>), and
underscores (<code>_</code>). For the technically inclined, <code>lineparser.py</code> contains full
regular expressions that specify the exact format for the declaration lines. It
also has some tests and examples, but it might be more instructive to browse a 
sample description (eg <code>spider.txt</code>).</p>

<h2>CONNECTORs:</h2>

<pre><code>LABEL -&gt; MATE pins "description" [alpha] [bcd] [M-mmate] [F-fmate]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>LABEL: name of the CONNECTOR being declared <code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,16}</code></li>
<li>MATE: name of the CONNECTOR to mate to (can be same as LABEL) <code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,16}</code></li>
<li>pins: the number of PINs (0 for unlimited) (integer <code>[0-9]{1,3}</code>)</li>
<li>description: any string not containing double quotes <code>[^"]{1,255}</code></li>
<li>alpha: (optional) present if PINs are alphanumeric, otherwise just numbered</li>
<li>bcd: (optional) present if box and CABLE mount versions of CONNECTOR differ</li>
<li>mmate: (optional) gender of MATE that male CONNECTORs mates to
   (omit if no male type) (gender <code>[mMfF]</code>)</li>
<li>fmate: (optional) gender of MATE that female CONNECTORs mates to
   (omit if no female type) (gender <code>[mMfF]</code>)
<ul>
<li>At least one of mmate and fmate must be specified</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>COMPONENTs:</h2>

<pre><code>CMPNAME "Description of the COMPONENT" [&lt; PARTOF]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>CMPNAME: short reference for the COMPONENT (<code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,8}</code>)</li>
<li>description: any string not containing double quotes (<code>[^"]{1,65}</code>)</li>
<li>PARTOF: (optional) reference to supercomponent (<code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,8}</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>CABLEs:</h2>

<pre><code>CABLE [&amp;]C## "description" [len]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>CABLE: declarations start with the word <code>CABLE</code></li>
<li>C##: the CABLE number (integer <code>[0-9]{1,8}</code> optionally preceded by <code>C</code>).
   When the <code>&amp;</code> is present, the number will be used as-is in the database.
   Otherwise, the number is a placeholder and a new one will be assigned.
   In either case it must be unique, even among COMPONENT names.</li>
<li>description: any string not containing double quotes (<code>[^"]{1,64}</code>)</li>
<li>len: (optional) the length in mm (omitted if unknown) (integer <code>[0-9]{1,8}</code>)</li>
</ul>

<h2>JACKs:</h2>

<pre><code>JACK [IN] [&amp;]ref "label" CONN/G -&gt; DEST[/jack] [CABLE [&amp;C##] "[desc]" [len]]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>JACK: declarations start with the word <code>JACK</code></li>
<li>IN: (optional) indicates a connection internal to a COMPONENT</li>
<li>ref: a string unique to JACKs on the parent part: <code>[a-z0-9]+</code>.
   Like cable numbers, ref can be preceded by <code>&amp;</code>, then must be an integer
   (<code>[0-9]{1,5}</code> optionally preceded by <code>J</code>) for use as-is in the database.
   Global jack numbers can't be repeated anywhere in a description, except
   for jacks that mate directly to each other (with no cable).</li>
<li>label: any string not containing double quotes (<code>[^"]{1,32}</code>)</li>
<li>CONN/G: CONNECTOR label (<code>[A-Z0-9_]{1,16}</code>) and gender (<code>[mMfF]</code>)</li>
<li>DEST: destination: COMPONENT (CMPNAME) or CABLE (C##)</li>
<li>jack: (optional) ref value of JACK on mating COMPONENT/CABLE. This can often
be omitted and the parser will find the matching JACK.</li>
<li>CABLE: (optional) declaration for p2p CABLEs with number (<code>[0-9]{1,8}</code>, 
 optional <code>C</code>), description (<code>[^"]{1,64}</code>), and length (<code>[0-9]{1,8}</code>).
 Similar to full CABLE declarations. If omitted, the JACK is taken to
 mate directly to its match on DEST.</li>
<li>&amp;C##: (optional) CABLE number. Unlike full CABLEs, when this is present it
should always be preceded by <code>&amp;</code>.
Non-database numbers for p2p cables are of no use</li>
<li>desc: (optional) CABLE description. When blank string <code>""</code> is used, will look
for value at DEST JACK, otherwise will invent a description</li>
<li>len: (optional) length in mm. If omitted, will look for value at DEST,
   otherwise will be treated as unknown</li>
</ul>

<h2>LINEs:</h2>

<pre><code>LINE "description" (jack;pin[,pin2,...])[,(jack;pin[,pin2,...]), ...]
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>LINE: declarations start with the word <code>LINE</code></li>
<li>description: any string not containing double quotes <code>[^"]{1,64}</code></li>
<li>(jack;pin): JACK reference and PIN number (<code>[A-Za-z0-9]{1,3}</code>) to connect to.
    For non-alphanumeric CONNECTORs, pin must be an integer <code>[0-9]{1,3}</code>
    and must be less than the total number of pins.
    Can specify a comma-separated list of PINs on a single JACK.
    Extra (jack,pin[,...]) tuples can be specified for LINEs that
    connect to PINs on multiple JACKs.</li>
</ul>
